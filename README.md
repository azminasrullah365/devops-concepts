## ⚡ General Cloud Terms

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)
A globally distributed network of servers that caches web content (images, videos, pages) and delivers it from the location physically closest to the end-user, reducing latency and improving site speed.

### Vendor Lock-in
A situation where a customer cannot easily migrate from one vendor's product or service to a competitor's without significant technical difficulties, high costs, or business disruption (often due to proprietary tech or high data egress fees).

### DigitalOcean
A cloud infrastructure provider known for its simple, developer-friendly platform, affordable "Droplet" VMs, and straightforward pricing, catering primarily to startups and SMBs.

### SonarQube
An open-source platform that performs continuous static analysis of source code to identify bugs, security vulnerabilities (SAST), and code smells across many programming languages.

## 🚀 Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Services

### Cloud Run
A serverless platform for running containerized applications that automatically scales based on demand (even to zero), ideal for web requests and event-driven workloads.

### Google Cloud Build
A serverless CI/CD platform that automates the building, testing, and deployment of software using a series of steps defined in a configuration file.

### GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
A fully managed Kubernetes orchestration service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications by handling control plane management and automation.

### Vertex AI
Google Cloud's unified platform for managing the entire AI/ML lifecycle, combining data science tools, MLOps, and generative AI interfaces (like Gemini and AutoML).

## 🛒 Amazon Web Services (AWS) Services

### AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)
A managed service that automates the setup, operation, scaling, and patching of popular relational databases (Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).

### AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
A highly durable, scalable, object storage service used for data lakes, backups, static website hosting, and general application storage.

### AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
A fully managed container orchestration service for Docker, offering both EC2 (self-managed VM) and Fargate (serverless) compute options.

### AI Inference on AWS
The process of running trained machine learning models in production using AWS services (like SageMaker) and specialized hardware (like Inferentia chips) to make real-time predictions.

### AWS Bedrock AgentCore
A suite of serverless services for building, deploying, and operating highly capable AI agents at scale, providing infrastructure for security, memory management, and tool integration.

### Jakarta Region
AWS's operational data center region in Indonesia (Asia Pacific - Jakarta, ap-southeast-3), launched in December 2021.

## 🛠️ CI/CD, Configuration, & AI Protocols

### cloud-init
An open-source tool used for automating the initial configuration of virtual machines (VMs) upon their first boot (e.g., setting hostname, users, running setup scripts).

### GitLab Runner
The execution agent that runs the jobs defined within a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD platform built into GitHub for automating workflows (builds, tests, deploys) using runners.

### Cloudflare Workers
A serverless edge computing platform that runs JavaScript/WASM code physically close to users via V8 isolates, providing ultra-low latency execution.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A new open-source standard that provides a standardized, secure way for AI models (LLMs) to access real-time external data and execute actions using tools/APIs.
